# PCB Hacker Card

A PCB business card that contains my name, LinkedIn, gmail, and Instagram tags. There is an NFC chip and an LED that will light up once the chip is scanned. I programmed the NFC chip to lead to my Linktree, but you can easily program the card to lead to any mobile link/application using the various NFC programming apps available (mobile).


The subtotal for five assembled PCBs costed $18.62. With the cheapest shipping option to Canada, the grand total is $30.96.

I tried to design my business card to be farily professional and minimal-looking. I included the handled to my social media profiles to the soldermask layer as I will be meeting many new faces in college, so I wanted this card to help me connect with others.
